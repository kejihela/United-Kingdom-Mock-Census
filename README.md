# United-Kingdom-Mock-Census
The goal of a census like this is to compare people across the country and offer accurate demographic numbers to the government so that it can plan better, formulate policies, and allocate resources.

**Background Information**
A mock census of a fictional small town was presented. As a members of a local government team tasked with deciding what to do with an undeveloped area of land and where to invest. we'll need to clean and analyze the mock census data provided to answer these questions.

**About the dataset**
The fake census was provide to make up of data generated at random using Python's Faker module. It was created in the same way as the 1881 census of the United Kingdom, in which only a few questions were asked of the population. The following are the fields that were recorded:

(1)	Marital status (one of: Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed, or “NA” in the case of minors);

(2)	Occupation (this field was implemented in a modern style, rather than typical 1881 occupations);
(3)	Religion (we have implemented a set of real-world religions).
(4)	First Name of occupant;
(5)	Surname of occupant;
(6)	Street Number (this is set to “1” if it is a unique dwelling);
(7)	Relationship to the “Head” of the household (anyone aged over 18 can be a “Head” – they are simply the person who had the responsibility to fill in the census details);
(8)	Age of occupant;
(9)	Infirmity (we have implemented a limited set of infirmities following the style of 1881);
(10) Street Name;
(11) Gender (one of: Male, Female; note that other responses were not implemented in 1881);

**Task**
According to the census, the town is a small one wedged between two considerably larger towns with which it is connected by highways. Although the town lacks a university, students live in the area and travel to adjacent cities. Once you've got a clean dataset to work with, you'll need to decide on the following:
